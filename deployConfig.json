  "detailedDescription": "Manage google groups from an easy to use spreadsheet. Can be configured to run every day at a certain time, or run on demand.\n\nThe add-on looks for a sheet named \"Members\" within your Sheets document with two columns, \"Email\" and \"Group\". Each line represents a single group membership.\n\nOn every run, the add-on will add and remove members from groups referenced in the sheet. It will create any missing groups, but it will not delete any groups."
